                Nana is the last born of the house, she was born on the 12th day of august, 2008. She has nothing to her name right now
                but hopefully, she'll put some things together real soon, even though she is still battling with what to study in secondary
                school. Her school fees is ridiculous but for some reason, alot of people want her there, including my late mom so she's
                definitely staying in the school. She likes to think she's an ajebo. Well, i don't blame her, its the things she gets in that
                school that's making her feel so. She is with our aunty Zuro sha, maybe she'll become wise one day.
