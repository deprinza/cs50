                school together but Jambo gained admission into the university a year earlier than his twin and as such, graduated
                a year earlier. However, she graduated with class 2021 from the department of public Admin from the same university
                and is now waiting for her Clarion call, meanwhile, she just quit her POS job and is working with a local NGO in maiduguri
                she really believes her money should be saved while she spends her brother's money because she plans on getting married
                like he won't get married himself.
